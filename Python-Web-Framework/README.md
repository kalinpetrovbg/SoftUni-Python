# VisitTurkey

### Exam project, for educational purposes

This is a web application for sightseeings in Turkey. 
The application has a public part, a private part and an administrative part.

Unregistered users can view all sightseeings (places).
Registered users can upload, edit and delete their own places. 

On the home page users can see the last 3 uploaded places.

The project has 3 main apps:
1. Website module - which contains the the models, forms and functionality of the main object in the project - places. Each place is registered to the user who has created it and only he can do CRUD operations on this specific place.
2. Accounts module - the module contains the user model and the logic for log in, log out and register. 
3. Profile module - once a registered user logs in, he can add more datails in order to complete his/her profile (it's not mandatory).
